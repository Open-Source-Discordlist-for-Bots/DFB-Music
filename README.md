# DFB Music - The music bot for Discordlist for Bots
DFB Music is the music bot for our server.
The question is. Why don't we include DFB Music in the Official DFB?
Well, DFB Music has about 500 lines of code, and the Official DFB about 300.
Together that would be over 800 lines of code, that would get confusing.
